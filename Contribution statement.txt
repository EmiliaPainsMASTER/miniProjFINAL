Contribution: Emi was in charge of the Code, Object Physics, and Collision (Emi and Jayson worked on some parts together on campus), Jayson was in charge of the assets/animation and level design structure, Rahman was in charge of the main menu (but wasn't able to implement it into the main code due to GitHub repository problems on his end, he was also hard to contact throughout the development of this project). Submitted low-quality footage almost near deadline.
