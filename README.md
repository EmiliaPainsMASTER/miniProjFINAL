# miniProjFINAL
 
miniProject containing the following Team <br/>
- Jayson Baldemor <br/>
- Emi Herdman <br/>
- Rahman Bari <br/>

Some issues with the game, if you can't jump at game start refresh i have no idea why it's like this <br/>
Third party assets used:
- [Lowpoly Toon Cat Lite](https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/3d/characters/animals/lowpoly-toon-cat-lite-66083)
Uses the model and the running animation
- [Low Poly Barriers Pack Free](https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/3d/props/exterior/low-poly-barriers-pack-free-201810)
Uses the ConcreteBarrier_08_v2.prefab
- TextMeshPro
(this comes from unity i think)<br/>
<br/>
**TODO** <br/>
- Sleep? <br/>
